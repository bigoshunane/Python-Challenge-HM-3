# Financial data Analysis 

The aim of this project is to develop python scripts:
    
    1.To analyze financial records of a bank given financial dataset named budget_data.csv.
                                                 
    2.To help rural town modernize its vote counting process/system given dataset named election_data.csv
    
## Python scripts analyze the records to calculate each of the following:

For PyBank:

   -The total number of months included in the dataset


   -The net total amount of "Profit/Losses" over the entire period


   -Calculate the changes in "Profit/Losses" over the entire period, then find the average of those changes


   -The greatest increase in profits (date and amount) over the entire period


   -The greatest decrease in profits (date and amount) over the entire period
   
For PyPoll:

   -The total number of votes casted.


   -A complete list of candidates who received votes.


   -The percentage of votes each candidate won.


   -The total number of votes each candidate won.


   -The winner of the election based on popular vote.



CSV files for both PyBank named budget_data.csv and PyPoll named election_data.csv are both found in folder named Resources and analysis result in text format for both PyBank and PyPoll are found in their respective folders.
