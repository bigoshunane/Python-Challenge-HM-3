# Financial data Analysis 

## Background
Whether financial, political, or social -- data's true power lies in its ability to answer questions definitively. So let's take what you've learned about Python requests, APIs, and JSON traversals to answer a fundamental question: "What's the weather like as we approach the equator?"

## Objective

The aim of this project is to develop python scripts:
    
-  To analyze financial records of a bank given financial dataset named budget_data.csv.
-  To help rural town modernize its vote counting process/system given dataset named election_data.csv
    
## Python scripts analyze the records to calculate each of the following:

## For PyBank:

-  The total number of months included in the dataset
-  The net total amount of "Profit/Losses" over the entire period
-  Calculate the changes in "Profit/Losses" over the entire period, then find the average of those changes
-  The greatest increase in profits (date and amount) over the entire period
-  The greatest decrease in profits (date and amount) over the entire period

## For PyPoll:
-  The total number of votes casted.
-  A complete list of candidates who received votes.
-  The percentage of votes each candidate won.
-  The total number of votes each candidate won.
-  The winner of the election based on popular vote.

CSV files for both PyBank named budget_data.csv and PyPoll named election_data.csv are both found in folder named Resources and analysis result in text format for both PyBank and PyPoll are found in their respective folders.
